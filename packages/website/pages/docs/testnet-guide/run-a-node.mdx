# Run a Taiko node Into

## Introduction

This is arguably the most important part of the testnet! Taiko is fully decentralized and relies on the community to run nodes.

This is an extended version of the guide at [simple-taiko-node/README.md](https://github.com/taikoxyz/simple-taiko-node/blob/main/README.md).

> Note: You will only be able to run a node regularly or as a proposer. In this testnet we're not running any provers.

> Inspired by https://github.com/smartcontracts/simple-optimism-node

## What's included

### Taiko Geth (L2 execution engine)

[taiko-geth](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-geth) is a fork of [go-ethereum](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum) with some changes according to Taiko protocol, it serves as a L2 [execution engine](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#execution-client), which needs to be coupled to a [consensus client](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#consensus-client) (in Taiko network, this will be the [taiko client](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-client)'s [driver software](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-client/tree/main/docs#driver)), like L1 ethereum execution engines, it will listen to new L2 transactions broadcasted in the L2 network, executes them in EVM, and holds the latest state and database of all current L2 data.

### Taiko client driver

[taiko client](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-client)'s [driver software](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-client/tree/main/docs#driver) serves as an L2 [consensus client](https://ethereum.org/en/glossary/#consensus-client). It will listen for new L2 blocks from the Taiko layer 1 protocol contract, then direct the connected L2 execution engine to insert them into its local chain through the [Engine API](https://github.com/ethereum/execution-apis/tree/main/src/engine).

### Taiko client proposer

[taiko client](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-client)'s [proposer software](https://github.com/taikoxyz/taiko-client/tree/main/docs#proposer) will fetch pending transactions in a L2 execution engine's mempool intervally, then try to propose them to the Taiko layer 1 protocol contract.

### Prometheus and Grafana

A [Grafana](https://grafana.com/) dashboard with a [Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) datasource is also included to display the L2 execution engine's real time status. You can visit it at [http://localhost:3000/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview?orgId=1&refresh=10s](http://localhost:3000/d/L2ExecutionEngine/l2-execution-engine-overview?orgId=1&refresh=10s).

## Run Node

### Start

```sh
docker compose up
```

This command starts the configured node. If you want to run it in the background, please add the `-d` flag (`docker compose up -d`).

If this is the first time you start the node, it will synchronize from the genesis to the present, which may take some time. You can monitor this progress through logs or in the local grafana dashboard and see the latest L2 chain status in [Taiko Alpha-1 L2 block explorer](https://l2explorer.a1.taiko.xyz/).

If you get an error that the `daemon docker is not running` or `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon`, Need to start the Docker Desktop, search for the Docker Desktop in the Start menu (or Spotlight/Finder for Mac) and run. Then rerun the command in the terminal `docker compose up -d`

### Stats (CPU/MEM USAGE %)
```sh
docker stats
```
This command will show you live data stream of your running containers (CPU/MEM USAGE %), consumption of your machine resources. Add prefix "`docker stats -a`" to display all containers.

### Stop

```sh
docker compose down
```

This command shuts down the node, but will keep all volumes, so next time you restart the node, it won't need to synchronize from the genesis again.

### Wipe

```sh
docker compose down -v
rm -f .env
```

These commands completely remove the node by removing all volumes used by each container.

## FAQs

#### Error Messages

When running a node it's normal for the node to run into errors, this doesn't mean that your node isn't working correctly. Most of the time the node resolves the errors. Some errors are there for the developers to easily debug if something goes wrong but can be ignored by users. The following table explains some error messages a bit more.

| Error message                                                                                | Explanation                                                                                             |
| -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Proposing operation error` <br></br> `error="failed to propose transactions: transaction reverted`      | There are other proposers competing for the limited block space. The node will try again after a while. |
| `Unhandled trie error: missing trie node`                                                    | You can ignore this error, it doesn't affect you and goes away after a while.                                                       |
| `Block batch iterator callback error` <br></br> `error="failed to fetch L2 parent block: not found` | You can ignore this error.                                                                                                    |
| `Proposing operation error` <br></br> `error="failed to propose transactions: insufficient funds for gas * price + value"` | Your L1 wallet has ran out of funds to cover the fees. Please add funds to L1.                                                                                                 |
| `Error starting ...: listen tcp4 0.0.0.0:{port} bind: address already in use` | The port is already in use by another service. You can either shut down the other program or change the port in the .env file. |
| `error parsing HTTP 403 response body: invalid character '<' looking for beginning of value` | Your IP address is being geo-blocked due to sanctions lists. Google seems to be accidentally blocking users from Germany for some reason as well. If you're affected, try changing hosting locations or utilize a VPN to change your IP address. |
| `Skip an invalid proposed transaction: hash=2a0330..576dd2 reason="nonce too low: address` | This is a common error. This one is okay to ignore. |
| `ERROR: The Compose file './docker-compose.yml' is invalid because: Unsupported config option for some_serivce 'pull_policy'` | Your docker installation is out of date. You need to update your docker compose installation https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/ |
|`daemon docker is not running` <br></br> `Cannot connect to the Docker daemon` | Need to start the Docker Desktop, search for the Docker Desktop in the Start menu (or Spotlight/Finder for Mac) and run. Then rerun the command in the terminal `docker compose up -d` |

#### View Docker Logs

To view the Docker logs, the following commands can be ran:

All Logs
```sh
docker compose logs -f
```

The proposer image's logs
```sh
docker compose logs -f taiko_client_proposer
```

L2 execution engine Logs
```sh
docker compose logs -f l2_execution_engine
```

#### Node Not Proposing Blocks

First, check that you have updated the optional environment variables in `.env` file correctly and are using the latest docker images (you can manually update local images with `docker compose down && docker compose pull`).

Next, check the proposer image's log (`docker compose logs -f taiko_client_proposer`) to figure out what could be wrong. It's probably because:

- Your local node is still catching up with the latest chain head
- Your L1 proposer account ran out of ETH (needed to propose tx's)
- There is no available block slot to propose in the TaikoL1 smart contract, so you must wait for one to become available (you can check the protocol smart contract's status with [`TaikoL1.getStateVariables`](https://taiko.xyz/docs/smart-contracts/L1/TaikoL1#getstatevariables))


If the above does not work, please try resyncing the images and start over

```sh
docker compose down -v
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
The commands below will redo the Step *Configure node as proposer (optional)* in the **Steps** section.

```sh
rm .env
cp .env.sample .env
update 3 lines in .env with true, a new private key and new account
docker compose up -d
```

#### Unclean Shutdown
When running a Node, will need to ensure a clean shutdown by running the command `docker compose down`

If the node is being ran with `docker compose up` (without the `-d` flag) and the logs are displaying in the terminal. Then Press CTRL+C to allow Docker to clean up the resources.

Please try running the following
```sh
docker compose down -v
git pull
docker compose pull
docker compose up -d
```
